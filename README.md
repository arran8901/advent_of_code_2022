# Advent of Code 2022 – My Solutions

My first crack at Advent of Code!

I used Java (17) to solve all the puzzles. Many of my solutions utilise some of Java's newer features such as records and the new switch statement. I also make good use of the Stream API.

Being my first attempt, I wasn't sure how far I would get through the calendar – so I was pleased to have solved almost all the puzzles myself. Part 2 of days 16, 17 and 19 were the most challenging for me and I needed hints to complete these.

The programs accept input from STDIN; I just copy and paste the input into the console rather than reading from a file.
